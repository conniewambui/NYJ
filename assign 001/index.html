	<p> One of my favorite part in the novel<i> Born a Crime</i> is when Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah <i>Trevor's mom</i> is straight forward to tell Swiss/German man Robert <i>Trevor's dad</i> that she wants to have kid with him, she gives him a condition that he wouldn't be responsible for it. In our society today and even back then this is unheard of. In South Africa back then apartheid is at it's peak no intermarriages is allowed between the foreigners that is the Chinese, Germans, Potuguese, Japanese, and the natives. Although it still happens. Patricia is wild, free , and daring she doesn't care or even think of the consequences of having a colored kid.<p> Although Robert is reluctant at first , later on he gives into Patricia's pleads. After nine months. Patricia gives birth to baby boy named Trevor Noah. The child violated any number of laws, statutes, and regulations, because of the laws back then, his mother claimed that , his father was from Swaziland a landlocked kingdom in the west of South Africa. Hence refers to the book title "Born a Crime".</p>

	<h2> The Power of Language<h2>

    <p> Another instance that excites me is whereby Trevor was walking  down the street , and a group of Zulu guys were walking behind him, they're speaking in their native language on how they were going to attack Trevor. Trevor spins around and speaks to them in Zulu, "Yo, guys , why don't we just mug someone together? I'm ready. Let's do it." The guys are shocked for a moment they start laughing and leave him alone. These are the minor incidences in life where Trevor realizes that language, even more than color, defines who you are to people. Trevor states that he was like a chameleon his color didn't change but he could change your perception of his color by knowing and conversing your language pretty well.</p>
    

    <p> In our day to day lives we face this kind of problems, not necessarily in terms of color but in terms of our surnames. For instance I come from Turkana people from Turkana, speak Turkana dialect, so if a "Wambui, Atieno, Amina, Jerop", is able to converse with them in their dialect it breaks the barriers and all the norms associated with it, they consider you one of their own because you can speak in their language. So you can't change your surname, but you change the perception of people when you're able to converse in their language.</p> 
     
     <h3><strong>Relationship Between a Mother and her Son</strong><h3>

    <p> Another instance that excites me is whereby Trevor's relationship with her mom was like that of a cop and a criminal, in the movies. They were bitter rivals but they respected the hell out of each other. There is this time Trevor goes to the shops with her to mother. Trevor loved toffee apple (candy) so when he is in the shop with his mother he starts asking for toffee apple and insists, his mother tells him to go get it. When they reach the cashier, Trevor's mom refuses to pay claiming that he didn't know him, since Trevor is colored and her mom is black she got away with it because the cashier could't put together a black woman having a colored kid. On the other hand Trevor was really confused and panicked because that was her mom. He questioned himself if he was crazy. I can relate to that with my son he loves playing football, they're many instances where I go to the supermarket with him and he starts crying for a ball worth ksh2500 and I have to confuse him with something else. However whenever we go to supermarket he still remembers and insists that he wants a ball.<p>

    	<h4> Trevor Drinks Grape Juice<h4>

    <p>When Trevor was a student at Maryvale, which was a Catholic school, on friday there used to be a mass, Trevor couldn't understand the communion rules because they were there for an hour, kneeling, standing, sitting, and the process would continue, by the end he would be starving, but was never allowed to take communion because he wasn't a Catholic. The other kids would eat jesus's body and drink his blood which was crackers and grape juice. What more could a kid want. Trevor being Trevor that didn't make sense to him. So one morning before mass he snuck behind the alter and drank the entire bottle of grape juice and ate the entire bag of Eucharist to makeup for all the times that he couldn't. If you have studied at a Catholic school  at a younger age , you will question that because back then you couldn't understand why others had communion and you didn't.<p>
